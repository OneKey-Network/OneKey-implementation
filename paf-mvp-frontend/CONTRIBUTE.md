# OneKey: contribute to the frontend project

You can run `npm start` to create a bundle and start server. The bundle will be available on
http://localhost:3000/dist/app.bundle.js

You can open http://localhost:3000/ to see how it looks like in the sandbox. To test app in "Real Environment", you can
inject script (as described above) to any website.

There are also available scripts:

* `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:prettier` - to lint a code style.

## Deployment

Once deployed, the bundle will be available by the path: `https://{{domain}}/app.bundle.js`
