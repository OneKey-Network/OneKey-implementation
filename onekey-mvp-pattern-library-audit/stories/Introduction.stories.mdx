# Welcome to the OneKey UI Audit log kit

This is the pattern library for the OneKey Audit log, built in Storybook to make it easy to understand the components, and easy to copy the examples for use in your application.

> If you haven't already, run `npm start` to start Storybook

<br/><br/>

## Building the pattern library

The two exports from this pattern library are the CSS and logo files. You can build those by running:

- `npm run build`

This will generate:

1. A minified, sourcemapped `./build/ok-ui-audit.css` file contain the styling just for the Audit log
2. A `./build/images/OneKey.svg` logo file

### Testing the built pattern library

You can validate that the build worked by running:

- `npm run build-test`

This will open a basic HTML file with the CSS included, and one of the groups from the pattern library as an example.

## Customising the styling

There is a `_vars.scss` file in the `./styles` directory where you can manage the core configuration of the styling.

There are three intended levels of customisation:

1. **Change the primary brand colour and the base font size variables.** You can personalise the appearance quickly with these two changes.
2. **Change the advanced variables.** Customise more of the brand colours, change the font styling more heavily.
3. **Changes the components.** Fully customise the component SCSS files in `./styles/components` to suit your needs.

## Copying the examples

The Groups section of the Storybook navigation contains the most useful HTML examples for you to copy into your application.

Make sure `Docs` is selected in the toolbar at the top, and then use the `Show Code` action at the bottom right of each canvas to copy the HTML you need to build that view. See the [Advert page](/docs/groups-advert--advert) example.
