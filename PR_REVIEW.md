# Pull Request Reviews

How to review a Pull Request in this repository.

## Principes

- The purposes of a review are:
    - sharing knowledge
    - ensuring a good maintenance
    - detecting defects
- Provide constructive feedbacks.
- There is no such thing as “perfect” code — there is only better code. Balance out the need to make forward progress compared to the importance of the changes you are suggesting.[1]
- Ask for a chat, a screensharing or face-to-face conversation when it can speed up the understanding of the change, the decisions on alternative designs, or for finding a consensus. Then sum up in the Pull Request comments when relevant.
- The verification described in this document contains both guidelines and rules. In case of guidelines, when there is no consensus between a reviewer and the submitter, the reviewer must ask to a(nother) maintainer to decide if the requested change is mandatory for merging or not.
- This document isn't immutable but isn't updated with a high frequency. It can be refined retrospectively after one or a set of Pull Requests.

### Verifications

Verify that:
- The Pull Request is dedicated to one small concern. The concern must be explicit in the title and the description of the Pull Request.
- The Pull Request is small. There is no hard limit but a Pull Request should not exceed 500 lines of code (excluding configurations and generated code).[2] As a reviewer, you must ask submitter to break out the PR if the amount of code coupled with its complexity is an impediment to achieving the purposes of a review.
- The (new or changed) production code has its test counterpart. Use the test pyramid as a guideline [3]:
    - **Unit-tests and Integration Tests via `Jest`**: The targeted code coverage is 80% on new or changed code. To estimate this coverage at *change level*, you can run `npm run coverage-change` *which measures the coverage at file level*.
    - **UI Tests via `Cypress`**: A large feature that includes UI should have *few* UI tests for covering the nominal cases. Estimate if those tests can be flaky (e.g network is not mocked, wait and timers API in tests, bypass Cypress API, production code with a not testable design). If so, you must ask for change.
- No warning or error appear from the linter.
- The code respects existing dependencies between sub-projects unless it is clearly stated in the description of the Pull Request with an acceptable rational.
- No unecessary external dependencies are added.
- The documentation in the repository is up-to-date with the code changes.
- The code is in Typescript. If there is new files with Javascript code, an acceptable rational must appear in the description of the Pull Request.
- The code hasn't an accidental complexity or bad practices. Use your jugement here.

### Type of comments

- Don't use prefix on you comment if you expect a discussion or a change in this Pull Request.
- Prefix a comment with `FAR` (For Another Review) when the comment isn't blocker for merging the change but that you expect a new Pull Request for this.
- Prefix a comment with `NIT` (NITpicking) when the comment is for polishing but if the submitter can choose to ignore.
